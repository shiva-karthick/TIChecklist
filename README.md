## Project's Aim
1) To simplify the task of collecting data from the vehicles
2) To synchronise the data, thus mitigating misinformation

### Forms, @yadunut for your info 
Packages used 
1) [Slidable buttons](https://github.com/letsar/flutter_slidable)
2) [Flutter forms builder](https://github.com/danvick/flutter_form_builder)

The bolded are the titles.

- **Appbar** : Type of detachment, ex : RID, DSD, TTD
- **Date/Time** : FormBuilderDateTimePicker - For Date, Time and DateTime input
- **Location of Detachment** : FormBuilderTextField
- **Action** : FormBuilderTextField
- 
- Use UIhelper class, to create a space
- 
- **Mission profile** : FormBuilderTextField
- Use UIhelper class, to create a space
- **Faulty items** : 
  - Each item will be a container widget, the name of the item will be a slidable widget.
  - The slidable widget will be able to Create,Delete (Create the structure of next item, Delete the item)
![Form sketch](../TIChecklist/form_sketch/Form_sketch.jpg)
- The same goes for Missing Items, Expiring items, Outstanding items.

#### Login Screen
When the user opens the app for first time, cache the name using (Shared Preferences) 
Cache the type of user - NSF/Regular.
#### Home Screen
The home screen contains 3 bottom navigation tabs: 
1. List of checklists
   1. Files in a folder will be parsed and shown as posts in this screen. If a post is clicked, it will show a view of the data. If an edit floating action button is clicked, it will direct to the editing screen where the user can edit and re-save the file again. 
2. Charts about the checklists
   1. A brief overview of the missing items, faulty items, Outstanding items.
   2. Provide options to look at certain Node vehicles.
3. Settings
   1. not really sure !

## Data Sources

There are three levels of data persistence:

  - In-memory cache - Fast
  - Disk (HiveDB) - Fast
  
Synchronization between layers is hard and depends on the case so it's out of the scope for the samples. The chosen sync implementation is very simple:

  - In every get operation:
    - Return in-memory cache if available, or
    - return info from disk 
  - Every write/delete operation will simply:
    - Update cache
    - Update local

## MVVM
For communication between the UI and the business logic, the architecture is similar to MVVM (Model View ViewModel).

The model is the data from a source like a database or the web. The view is the UI, like a screen or widget. The view model is the business logic sitting between the UI and the data. It provides data in a form that the UI can present, but it knows nothing about the UI itself. This differs from the MVP architecture. The view model also doesn‚Äôt know where the data comes from. That‚Äôs abstracted away.

Each view.dart will have its own view model. The view model will define the methods and user services to accomplish tasks such as fetching data from disk to displaying in the screen. 

The process is roughly shown below.

- view <-> viewmodel <-> (Model) <-> Services

Here is a more detailed view, 
![architecture diagram](../TIChecklist/form_sketch/advanced_architecture.png)

Note these points:
- The UI screens listen for changes in the view models. They also send events to the view models.
- The view models don‚Äôt know any details about how the UI looks.
- The business logic interacts with an abstract service. It doesn‚Äôt know anything about the local storage or the web. This type of architecture is sometimes called a data repository.
